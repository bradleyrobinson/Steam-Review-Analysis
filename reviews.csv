The game is as simple or complex as the player wants it to be, and the game has beauty in its brevity and complexity, both at the same time. The HD edition brings up this timeless classic to the new millennium with resolution up to 4K (I play in 2K resolution and it looks gorgeous). The support for steam workshop mods is the icing on the cake.I would recommend getting all the three DLCs for the game as they add new game mechanics and gameplay features along with specific maps that require you to apply unconventional strategies to better your opponent. The developers are also active with regular patches and patch fixes for any issues that the players face. It has not been a smooth sailing for the whole journey, but I appreciate all the hard work everyone has put in and the community of players for keeping with game alive.If ever aliens visit the earth and ask humanity to show them the two best games ever, I would choose this game and another one (which I shouldn't mention here as this is a review for AOE II HD).\t\t\t"", '\nPosted: February 9\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tWololo wololo.

Gameplay wise, it mimics Dragon Ball Xenoverses\' play style and controls, but adds onto that with combo training, all new basic skills, a deeper mission base, and an overall more fitting plot. You can transfer over you Dragon Ball Xenoverse character as the city hero, which is a neat little feature to make you feel more involved in BOTH games! However, the game does suffer a little from such a great release...While it\'s an impressive game and a fun one at that, one of the downsides is the desire for more Dragon Ball content, both Pre-Z saga and GT, that doesn\'t present itself - considering it\'s titled ""Xenoverse"". Another fluke that people may experience is a crashing event that happens on PC during a mission, whilst talking to an NPC, or simply walking around the city. While a patch was released, there are still some issues to be had with it.Overall, Dragon Ball Xenoverse 2 has to be one of my top picks for a ""Game of the Year"" place so far. The DLC should be promissing enough to hold this place for some time, give or take if the DLC is more quality content. While it has some bugs to be fixxed, don\'t let it stop you from trying this game out - it\'s a blast to have and play and it\'s one you won\'t regret to have in your collection!\t\t\t', '\nPosted: February 8\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tNot to be mean but this game is so crap in PC.. endlees room crashes evertime when someone joines the wrong time. BP is hacked. so is TP. and there are still alot of hackers who uses hacks to WIN.. this game would be very fun if all this crap was removed...\t\t\t', '\nPosted: February 8\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tWhat can I say? It\'s a Dragon Ball game, and you get to wreck all who stand in your path in a major way.But I only barely recommend this game because it lacks so much polish. There are a lot, and I mean A LOT of dialogue quirks. So much dialogue doesn\'t match the subtitles that it\'s almost laughable. There\'s one part in particular where two voice clips were swapped entirely in the main story, leading to some head scratching on my part. Some moves will just not work, even in the tutorial missions for those moves, and I had a tutorial mission where my instructor always messed up his move and I got stuck.In the expert missions, when you have to repel a giant ki blast, sometimes said blast will be fired out of bounds, leaving you stuck because it never actually ""hits.""As far as the story goes... it\'s a mess. There are inconsistencies and plot holes all over the darn place. The dialogue is uninspired, usually repetitive and childish. The story only shines where it does the original DBZ story justice, which it does really, really well, but nothing about this game\'s story by itself was memorable or groundbreaking.And while this may not be worth mentioning because the game\'s nature made it so it had to be this way, but the escalation of enemies\' power in the story mode was very underwhelming. The difference in enemies\' power in the anime was staggering, as they became exponentially tougher, but in this game, well, you can hold off SSGSS Goku with... Hercule.... Just let that sink in....And I don\'t play multiplayer much, but many other reviewers are saying that there\'s a lot of cheating about, and I\'m not a fan of that if it\'s true.Despite the above issues, it\'s a really fun fast-paced fighter with a whole bunch of stuff to do. And I know it\'s the norm nowadays for full-price games to lack polish like this game does, but to me, it\'s still unexcusable for this game and all others. I regret buying this game at full price, so try to grab it on sale.And don\'t even look at the special edition or season pass. They should focus on the core game before adding anything, and I almost find it offensive that they want more money for such nonsense as those offer.\t\t\t', '\nPosted: February 8\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t     So I\'ve been playing the game for 72 hours now and I really wanted to give my opinion about it. The fact is I have read a lot of Steam reviews before buying it and I would not have bought the game if I had listened to the reviews. There are a lot of people out there complaining about the game being full of bugs and problems, and that it ruins the experience. Well I think this is unfair.     Let\'s set the context. I am a big fan of the DB universe and I played a lot of DBXV1. I did crack it at first and I loved playing it so hard I finally bought it. The game was not perfect. In my opinion, the gameplay was too simple, too ""casul"". The combos were a lot too poor, there were not enough possibilities to make fancy stuff. Furthermore, the hub was empty. In Tokitoki City, the character could not fly so the hub was reduced to the strict minimum and it had nothing interesting to offer. A simple menu would have done the job perfectly right. Plus the main quest was a little short. I was not really annoyed by the farming system for I never really had to farm a lot to get the skills I wanted.     The game made a wonderful job at making you feel part of the DB universe. Every aspect of the game from the design to the skills and the sounds were completely loyal to the DB universe so the immersion was real. In addition, even being poor, the gameplay was efficient. The character was always doing the thing you wanted at the time you wanted, so the combats were punchy.     So, what about DBXV2? I think it has everything DBXV1 made good. Plus a lot of the bad stuff is not there anymore.¤ The hub   You can now fly in the hub!! Well that\'s a change. Now the hub is a lot bigger, with a lot more things to do aside from the main quest. That is nice, a cool addition.¤ The combat system   You have now more possibilities in combat. Yeah, the basic combos are always there and by just mashing one button, you will see your character teleport everywhere without you feeling the action, but you can now learn to make fancy stuff were you really need to press the right input at the right moment for your character to perform badass moves. That\'s really satisfying. In addition, you don\'t have anymore ""super-armour"". In DBXV1, certain bosses had kind of an ""infinite poise"", making them impossible to stagger. This was frustrating, you could not end any combos for there were hitting you will you were hitting them. Well out with it. In DBXV2, you will not find it anymore (not true: Giant apes always have it but this is fair. There are giant apes dammit).¤ The Super Saiyan   Where to begin? In DBXV1, the SSJ tranformations were... kinda weird. Being transformed, the super and ultimate attacks did not consum any Ki, but the Ki bar was gradually emptying as time passed. When the Ki bar was empty, you turned back to normal. So the tactic was to spam ultimate attacks until your Ki bar emptied itself. This is true no more. Now, while being transformed, you get damage bonuses depending on the transformation, the super and ultimate attacks consume the normal amount of Ki and the Ki natural regeneration is slower. I think it is more fun, I now have the impression of being a real SSJ :). Plus, guys... Now we have SSJ3. My character in SSJ3. I wanted nothing more from this game.¤ The 4rth ultimate attack button   In DBXV1, you had this weird empty 4rth option in your ultimate attack list. The \'B button\' (xbox controller) option for the ultimate attack was empty and there was no way to assign an ultimate attack to this input. This was not a real bad game-breaking thing, but it was, you know, weird. This is not the case anymore. You can now have one evasive move, one awaken skill (transformation) and two ultimate attacks. Sweet!¤ Lags, bugs...   Well, I\'ll be honest: I have a weak computer. It is not a powerful machine and I play Dark Souls 3 800x600 with 30 to 10 FPS depending on the area. I play DBXV2 1600x1200 and the game gets to 60 fps easier than DBXV1 did with the same resolution. I don\'t now if this is a miracle that will only happen on my machine, but I wanted you to know. I read a lot of complains about bame-breaking bugs while playing. Okay, there are the facts about my gameplay: I played all the srotyline, every 99 PQ plus a certain amount of training and time rift missions. I got stuck in the ground once, nothing more. Well I think this is a pretty weak amount of game-breaking bugs, but you\'re free to have another opinion.     I won\'t talk about Pvp here: I am no big fan of Pvp so I have no opinion on it.     All in all, I freakin\' love this game. I am not done with it, I have to get the secret ending and to try out Expert Missions and I am so happy having not completly endend it yet. The game is fun, no regret with having got it.

But like with every game it has its good points and its flaws. Here are some laid out so you can know some of what to expect before you get into the game.     [Some of the Flaws?]- Online mode for the most part is dead unless event raids appear. Sure, in the online public lobby a lot of players are present depending on the time of day, but most of those players aren\'t interacting with the online aspect of the game. So expect to be doing the majority of the online optional missions by yourself unless you play with a friend. If you\'re in it for the PVP don\'t get your hopes up. There are a lot of improvements to be made to the PVP system.- Every now and then the game will crash while scrolling through menus. What causes this? I\'m unsure. But it seems to be consistent across reviews and bug complaints. Mind you, this probably won\'t occur often enough to interfere with actual game play. But do be wary as it can happen.- You can\'t type in-game. Written communication is done via fixed chat where you\'re given a set amount of predetermined phrases to say, such as ""Hello"" and ""Recruiting for Expert Missions"" and everything else is done via voice communication through use of a microphone.- The wishes you can make to Shenron are lackluster at best and they don\'t give the feeling that you need to make this wish. The various wishes you can make that don\'t help you 100% the game could be done in a faster amount of time than trying to grind for the Dragon Balls.Here are a few examples to prove my point.Want to wish for Zenni?  You can get a lot of Zenni and fast just by selling various items that commonly drop or doing missions. It takes about an hour or 2 on average (depending on RNG) to grind for all 7 Dragon Balls just to make a wish for 500,000 Zenni, while during that grind for the Dragon Balls you get items such as Hercule\'s Badge (Common, Rare, Super Rare, Legend) which can be sold for a huge sum of Zenni in any shop allowing you to potentially rake in 1 million Zenni in under that of 1 or 2 hours.Want to wish for a free level up? The grinding in this game isn\'t difficult. You don\'t need to invest much time in the game to level up. You\'d actually be wasting more time grinding for the Dragon Balls to make the wish to level up once than actually doing missions to level up.    [Some of the Positives?]- The customization options for your custom character is pretty good. There are a lot of options to be explored in the custom menu and you can do a variety of things to your character to make it stand out.- The story is great and unique compared to a lot DBZ games out there. If you\'re like me and have played a lot of DBZ games you\'d quickly notice the reoccurring trend of diving into the same story that was presented in the anime over and over. It gets pretty boring after awhile, constantly experiencing the same story. Xenoverse 2 does the story a little differently. While you do go through the same events that happened in the anime there are nice twists given to them, which opens up a whole new experience not really seen before in any DBZ game.- The combat is smooth, fast and fluent. You feel like you\'re controlling your character and the controls aren\'t convoluted. The game is very fast-paced so it\'s easy to get involved quickly.- The character roster is HUGE. And since the game is still relatively new it\'s still updating with DLC, allowing for more characters to be added.- At the time, there isn\'t a complete English dub for Super. Xenoverse 2 is the only place (as far as I\'m aware) where you can hear the English VA\'s for new Super characters such as Cabba, Black, Hit, etc.- The game isn\'t grindy. Sure grinding exists, but it\'s not to an extent where you spend the whole day attempting to get one thing. The leveling system is also very fast as well. The only time when leveling might start to feel slow is when you reach lvl 83. But cap is currently lvl 85 so it\'s not really a big deal.-The game has very nice anime cinematic cut scenes. They accurately resemble the anime itself and you feel like you\'re actually watching the show.    [Various miscellaneous small things that most people probably wouldn\'t mind, but are still present.]                                  1.) There aren\'t any options for custom Saiyans to have tails.                                 2.) The Frost Demon race has a Golden form, but Saiyans don\'t have a Godform much less a Super Saiyan 4 form. This might be added in the future seeing as the game is still young, but who knows.                                 3.) Upon going Super Saiyan and Super Saiyan 2 the custom Saiyan\'s hairstyle will not change in appearance from base form. It will just turn blonde and you will don the classic yellow aura (aura lightning starting at Super Saiyan 2). Upon going Super Saiyan 3 the hair will change, but every custom Saiyan has the same Super Saiyan 3 wig. So every custom Saiyan will look the same upon going Super Saiyan 3.                               4.) Black is pre-order exclusive. You didn\'t pre-order? You lucked out and you\'re unable to use him unless there is an update in the future that says differently.                  Overall I\'d give this game an 8/10.\t\t\t', '\nPosted: February 7\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tIts fun to play with friends. once in a while there is a crash. havent tried pvp yet\t\t\t']","['\nPosted: February 5\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\ti was looking for the booty and i never found it!\t\t\t', '\nPosted: February 3\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tIt would be nice if the next reboot has voice actor =v=!\t\t\t', '\nPosted: February 2\nProduct received for free\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tin depth story\t\t\t', '\nPosted: January 17\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tJapan\t\t\t', ""\nPosted: January 15\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tIf you're a weaboo; buy itIf you're looking for fap material; this could work...

A visual novel that will provide you with 5 choices in as many hours, so more of an interactive fiction than an actual game. The best part for me personally was the option to add the Japanese text. And if you can read that I suggest you do, because the translation is sometimes off. It\'s also not a very literal translation so you can pretty much forget about learning Japanese with this. What it does do, though, is provide people who\'ve never been there with some (not too many) practical tips, an unrealistic expectation of how much it will cost you (it tracks your expenses, but you never go buy juice or any such trivial stuff and get free meals almost all the time), and what to expect (to a minor degree I\'d say). This was very obviously designed by Japanese for foreigners who love anime and may or may not have been sponsored by some tourist organization (at least it feels as if it were made as contract work for such an organization). It certainly reflects how Japanese people think foreigners think about Japan and at some point tries to justify caging animals in zoos and aquariums by saying: ""They don\'t know a world beyond this, so they won\'t miss it"". In the end it\'s not exactly bad, but kind of cliched and with so much tourist information that the actual story could have been told in one or two anime episodes. Production value is kind of mediocre, too. Cheap music, nice pictures, okay writing (Japanese), no voice-over, only a handful of sound effects.\t\t\t', '\nPosted: January 13\nProduct received for free\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tBest game ever,i love it!\t\t\t', '\nPosted: January 6\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tPros: Great visual novel.

Rise isn\'t a game you play for its complexity.  You play it like you play Chess.  It has very simple mechanics, but understanding how they come together is the hard part.  Heck, this game is better than Chess, way better.  Chess is a game that\'s plagued by alternating turns, using the same pieces all the time, and having to play with them in the same position.  Bobby Fischer improved on this through Chess 960 that randomized the pieces in the back line, but Rise goes one step further in randomizing your whole army.  You start with a blank board, and after a random draft of the five types of pieces, you take turns placing them in your starting area.  This doesn\'t create a problem like Chess either because while going first gives you first dibs so you know you won\'t miss out on a rare piece type, going second lets you pick the counter to that unit.  This means you can\'t be good at Rise like you can in Chess.  You can\'t memorize a book of openings, get used to certain patterns from the opening combinations, or simply practice your end game techniques to finish.  Rise forces you to constantly adapt in little ways, especially since all the pieces move at once.  Traps don\'t involve taking advantage of how one piece moves at a time and choosing which piece to move.  Instead, you have to take advantage of the rhythm of the board and disrupt the overall harmony of the opponent\'s force.  On the other hand, you\'re not playing a real time strategy game here either which means rhythm and harmony aren\'t subject to how fast you click.The game takes command realism a step further by letting units closer to your general move first, letting more agile units go before sluggish units, and letting units deployed first go before units deployed after.  Furthermore, if your general dies, then you don\'t lose right away unlike getting checkmated in Chess.  Instead, your units just become weaker, so ""counter-check"" and ""breakthrough"" strategies are feasible.  Your general is also the strongest unit on the board unlike how your queen is stronger than your king.  The one problem with Rise is it doesn\'t have a very active player base.  The game kind of feels like a beta version because of that.  You can\'t chat in games, add friends from games, or host tournaments.  That said, if you have friends who like games like this, you will enjoy playing this regularly with them just for fun.  It\'s the kind of game where you can learn each other\'s playstyles over time, and joke around about how you\'re used to each other playing a certain way and got surprised when you guys did something unexpected.\t\t\t', '\nPosted: June 20, 2016\nProduct received for free\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tRise: Battle Lines:~~~~~~~~~~~~~~  Medieval times were difficult in so many ways, especially with these long and bloodthirsty wars between kings and kingdoms.

Raise your army and prepare to challenge an opponent in a snappy fifteen minute medieval battle!Rise: Battle Lines is a turn-based strategy game primarily designed to play against online opponents. However, you can play the game against the AI or even with a friend on same computer in a hotseat battle. You can also play a quick and comprehensive tutorial before you take on an online opponent. Your grand army of ten will be a combination of five units: knights, swordsmen, axemen, crossbowmen, longbow men plus a general. All units have different point attributes which are attack, defend, move and range. At the start of a game, you will enter a draft where you and your opponent will be selecting your units. I really like this feature; all you know is that both armies will have ten soldiers but you won’t know until the draft is done how many of the units you will have to choose from. To give you an idea, in one draft we had to choose between eight swordsmen, three crossbowmen, five knights, one axeman and one longbow man. Then you and your opponent will take alternate turns to select your units, one by one. After that, you will be ready for battle!   The battlefield or board is setup in the shape of a hexagon. Your two armies will be each side of the screen at the beginning of the battle. Both players will be able to select all their units (if you want but you are not obliged to do so) one by one and move them across the board. If you play an online game, there is a time limit, but there is no time limit against the AI. When your units are within range of an opposing soldier, you can select to attack him. When you eliminate the enemy (including the General), you win the game and you will be given points. You can customise your coat-of-arms too, wish is a fun. There are a number of designs to unlock in our heraldry by winning battles and collecting points.The graphics are nice and the game is very easy to get into.

When I played this game and I am glad I played this game, it’s getting me hooked to the strategy genre. The game is a combination of turn based strategy, and chess. Having not played most strategy games I had a blast with this game. You can play with AI or play online with random people or invite your friends to play with you online. Furthermore you can even play locally with friends with the turn by turn system. Graphics:  The game looks good and the top down view gives plenty of details and the texture quality seems to be nice as well. There are presets of graphics on this game so even if you are playing on a very old PC you can crank the settings down and play. Other than that there’s the usual resolution adjustment, post processing filter of some sort (looks like motion blur to me) and a couple of other options like use regular windows cursor instead of the games’ one. Sound:  The music in this game is very good and the tutorial is voice acted and surprisingly good voice acting at that. I have no problems with the music I can listen to it all day long. Gameplay:  You can play the strategy game by yourself with the AI, there’s 3 levels of AI. Easy, medium and hard. You can play online with random people within your skill level or you can play with friends (online and local). When you beat someone you get points and as you get points you unlock styles/designs for your shield which is like your custom avatar. I think this game is very underrated as I had a blast playing. It has one of those Steam notification systems where steam will send you a notification when it’s your time to move so I think that’s a neat feature as you can also minimize the game and do something else in the meanwhile.  Graphics: 8/10   Sound: 7/10   Gameplay: 9/10   Overall: 8/10   Conclusion:  All in all this is a very fun game and I highly recommend it if you like chess and strategy games.Price is reasonable too and if you want it even cheaper wait for a sale.\t\t\t', ""\nPosted: April 17, 2016\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tA good little game with simple but novel mechanics that are easy to pick-up.

Soviet Monsters: Ekranoplans is a simulation and strategy game developed by Santa's & Co. and published by Merge Games and IV Productions. It was released in July 2016. You, the player, own a historical Russian ekranoplan and you use it to complete missions. The simulation tag is through you controlling your ekranoplan to complete missions whereas the strategy aspect is through hiring crew members, purchasing equipment, and regularly monitoring both. The idea for the game of owning an ekranoplan, controlling it, and then playing it was a very neat idea on paper, but fails in execution. Its lack of polish and abundance of issues screams unfinished development. For instance, there is no in-game options menu, instead the options menu is displayed prior to launching the game. Furthermore, the max resolution is 1680x1050, which is a big issue because the text within the game goes off the screen. That affects mission briefings because each mission has requirements, for instance, you need five soldiers, two pilots, and so forth, so with the unclear text, you cannot see the full requirements to launch a mission. My main issue lies in the lack of explanation of informing the player what you need to do, what is the objective, and how do you play the game. For instance, it is unclear on how to operate the ekranoplan, specifically, explanation on buttons such as the one that lifts your ekranoplan. In saying that, the game does feature a tutorial, but it is very basic and mostly unhelpful. To showcase its unfinished state, the game has no save game feature which is a nuisance because missions are lengthy and you cannot leaving unless you want to restart. Furthermore, Soviet Monsters has placeholder filler text such as 'dddd' instead of the names of cargo.The gameplay within this is not much better at all. The controls are very buggy and unresponsive. Driving the ekranoplan is mostly difficult because the controls have a delayed response, which means it's quite difficult to turn. Not all of the models are difficult, but the majority are. You can enable your ekranoplan to rapidly increase its speed and fly, but it is embarrassing because you are not going far up into the air, you are barely off the water. Finally, with no save games creates a very frustrating experience because if you turn off your ekranoplan prematurely for any reason, it glitches by massively swaying, or alternatively, goes into a rampage which means you cannot control it and essentially you have to restart the mission.Soviet Monsters has subpar performance. On my PC, the game on average uses 20% of your CPU and 2,000mb of memory, making my PC run loud. This may be an early-release thing, but it's not the worst thing to happen to this game. Loading times for missions are quite lengthy at about thirty seconds, which if you have to frequently restart due to the issues causes frustration. But hey, this game uses unity and the Internet states the engine sucks. In saying all this, I can sustain a solid FPS over 50 for the most part. Overall, the performance in its current state is not that good but it’s a fresh breathe of air considering the issues that plague the game.The game is not terrible as it seems as it does have some positives. Notably, the game features very nicely designed ekranoplans. It also features a fine looking environment that has quality water and random weather effects. So, each level could either be sunny, snowing, night time, and so forth. These weather effects really do complement the landscape when you complete a mission, however, these weather effects significantly hit FPS by making the game regularly stutter. If a mission is sunny, you can look at the scenery and design of the ekranoplan through various solid camera angles. If a mission is at night time, you cannot see the long distance but you can get some slick graphics that showcase the night environment. There are various ekranoplans and all have different abilities such as accelerating faster, carrying more cargo, higher top speed, and so forth. It's nothing big but it adds some variety to the game. In saying that, it is odd the player has access to the very best ekranoplans  instead of an unlocking system that would have been preferred in this type of game.  Conclusion  Soviet Monsters: Ekranoplans is a very poor game in an unfinished state. It features a profound amount of issues, particularly in the UI and gameplay components. It has a lack of features to help explain and progress in the game such as a very basic tutorial and no save game features. The performance is mediocre as I can manage to have a stable 50FPS, but weather affects dramatically reduce FPS and loading times are long. Soviet Monsters' primary feature is the variety of ekranoplans that are strongly designed and very detailed. I believe early access would have ensured a much more stable release because I was disappointed in my play through of it. At USD$12.74, I cannot recommend this in its current state.Rating: 3/10  Pros  \t- Very detailed ekranoplans.\t- A solid landscape and impressive weather effects.  Cons  \t- A very buggy and unpolished game.\t- Lack of features, such as no save game.\t- Somewhat un-optimised performance.\t- Long loading times.\t- Very basic tutorial.
